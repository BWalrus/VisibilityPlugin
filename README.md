### VoidList

* Clicking `VoidList` will open up a GUI for adding/removing players from the voidlist.
	* You can manually add players to the voidlist via `/void firstname lastname worldname reason`
	* You can manually add targeted players to the voidlist via `/voidtarget reason`

## Known Issues
* Own player might disapper. If that happens, use the `Refresh` functionality.
